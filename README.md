# UPCScanner
Simple system for a cash register.

How it works: 
The user enters the UPC of the products he wants to find to the terminal. 
Then the application will find the items scanned and displayed them with their name and price. 
The total ammount the customer owes will appear at the end.

If the UPC does not pertains to any product in the inventory a line indicating so will be printed and it will not cause the application to break down.
